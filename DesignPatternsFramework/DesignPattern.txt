SRP Design Pattern -
The Single-Responsibility Principle is one of the design pattern
that states that every module, class should have responsibility over a
single part of that program's functionality.

Example -
1. When a class is highly coupled with more responsibilities,
any small change to requirement could easily lead to many changes in
other parts of code which is harder to maintain.

2. SRP helps developers write code that are decoupled, where each class
has it's own job and encapsulate responsibilities to other classes.
If specifications of this job changes, developer makes changes to that
specific class only.

3. The change is less likely to break entire application as other
classes should still be doing their job as before, unless of course they
were broken in first place.
